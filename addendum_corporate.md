ADDENDUM A
CORPORATE COMPLIANCE NOTICE

This Addendum supplements the Proprietary Software License Agreement and applies to any entity, organization, partnership, corporation, academic institution, government body, collective, startup, DAO, or group chat consisting of more than one human being (“Organization”).

1. PROHIBITION ON ORGANIZATIONAL DEPLOYMENT

The Software is licensed strictly for individual personal use.

No Organization may:

Deploy the Software across multiple user accounts

Integrate the Software into managed browser environments

Distribute the Software internally

Reference the Software in policy, tooling, or infrastructure

Any such deployment constitutes material breach.

2. NO IMPLIED ENTERPRISE RIGHTS

Possession of the source code does not imply:

Deployment rights

Multi-user rights

Audit rights

Customization rights

Integration rights

If you are reading this from a corporate network, close the tab.

3. AUDIT RIGHTS

Licensor reserves the right to request written certification that the Software is not deployed in any Organizational environment.

Failure to respond within thirty (30) days constitutes presumptive breach.

4. NO PROCUREMENT LOOPHOLES

The following do NOT create license rights:

Expense reimbursement

Contractor status

“Just testing it”

“It’s only five people”

“It’s technically a Discord server”

If more than one person is using it under coordination, it is enterprise usage.

5. INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

Licensor may seek immediate injunctive relief without bond for any unauthorized organizational use.

Yes, this is wildly disproportionate. That is intentional.

5. TERMINATION FOR VIBES
